# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Wrestling Scheduler! Please follow these steps when contributing:

1. **Pick an issue** or file to work on, open conversations (issues or discussions) if you need clarification.
2. **Set up locally** by running `npm install` (or `yarn install`) at the repo root, then `npm run lint`/`npm run test` when applicable.
3. **Branch from `master`** and make focused commits; include a summary of your changes and the reasoning behind design decisions.
4. **Document your work**: update relevant fixtures, components, or README sections when behavior changes.
5. **Run linters/tests** before opening a PR; explain any known deviations in the description.
6. **Push and submit a PR** targeting `master` with a clear title, description, testing notes, and any open questions.

If your contribution touches data formats, fixtures, or APIs, add regression tests or update existing ones when feasible so regressions are detectable in CI.
